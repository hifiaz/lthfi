# About Me

My name is Luthfi Azhari, at high scholl called me Fiaz take from middle name Luth**FI AZ**hari. I’m a developer, designer, content creator. I currently work as a Project Manager/Head IT Department for [MediaWave](http://www.mediawave.id/). I also make video tutorial about programming for [devindo](https://www.youtube.com/devindo)


I started this website as a place to document everything I learned while transitioning from designer to developer. I’ve continued throughout my career and the free resources I create help thousands of people successfully become developers. Please consider [supporting me with a coffee](https://ko-fi.com/hifiaz). (I might use it towards beer.)
